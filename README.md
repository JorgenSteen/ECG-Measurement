# ECG Measurement
This repository contains different ECG measuring systems.

Each are compatible with each other but some parts are made for eachother.

1. The learning circuit is made for the LabVIEW software.

#The learning circuit
It is made for the purpose of changing the values and seeing how it changes the readings of the circuit.
The values which are choosen are chosen because of their frequency respons.
The only thing i i would have changed if i made it again is C4.
I would increase it to a high level to lower the cutoff frequency.
I did not change it in the plans as the frequency would not represent the circuit.

#LabVIEW software
It is made for viewing, simple filtering and saving the data from the ECG-circuit with the myDAQ
You could really use any ADC that can measure at least +-5V.
